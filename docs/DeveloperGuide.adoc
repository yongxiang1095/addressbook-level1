[[SettingUp]]
== Setting up

*Prerequisites*

* JDK 9 or later
* IntelliJ IDE

*Importing the project into IntelliJ*

. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. If JDK 9 is listed in the drop down, select it. If it is not, click `New...` and select the directory where you installed JDK 9
.. Click `OK`
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the project directory and click `OK`
. Select `Create project from existing sources` and click `Next`
. Rename the project if you want. Click `Next`
. Ensure that your src folder is checked. Keep clicking `Next`
. Click `Finish`

== Design

AddressBook saves data in a plain text file, one line for each person, in the format `NAME d/DOB p/PHONE e/EMAIL`.
Here is an example:

....
John Doe d/01.12.90 p/98765432 e/johnd@gmail.com
Jane Doe d/31.01.00 p/12346758 e/jane@gmail.com
....

All person data are loaded to memory at start up and written to the file after any command that mutates data.
In-memory data are held in a `ArrayList<String[]>` where each `String[]` object represents a person.

[[Testing]]
== Testing

*Windows*

. Open a DOS window in the `test` folder
. Run the `runtests.bat` script
. If the script reports that there is no difference between `actual.txt` and `expected.txt`,
the test has passed

*Mac/Unix/Linux*

. Open a terminal window in the `test` folder
. Run the `runtests.sh` script
. If the script reports that there is no difference between `actual.txt` and `expected.txt`,
the test has passed

*Troubleshooting*

* Problem: How do I examine the exact differences between `actual.txt` and `expected.txt`? +
Solution: You can use a diff/merge tool with a GUI e.g. WinMerge (on Windows).

* Problem: The two files look exactly the same, but the test script reports they are different. +
Solution: This can happen because the line endings used by Windows is different from Unix-based
OSes. Convert the `actual.txt` to the format used by your OS using some https://kb.iu.edu/d/acux[utility].

* Problem: Test fails during the very first time. +
Solution: The output of the very first test run could be slightly different because the program
creates a new storage file. Tests should pass from the 2nd run onwards.
